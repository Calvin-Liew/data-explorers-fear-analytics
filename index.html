            Before diving into the visuals, here's what the dataset looks like.
            Every scene went through a scripted GPT-4o-mini review (with GPT-4o
            fallbacks), prompting the model to extract structured stats, tag
            horror signals, and score emotions, turning raw screenplays into
            quantifiable dread.

          <h3>What Is a Signal?</h3>
          <p>
            A signal is any recurring lexical cue that our models associate with
            a spike in fear or tension. Examples include ambience terms like
            <em>night, silence, fog</em>, visceral triggers like
            <em>blood, scream, knife</em>, supernatural hints such as
            <em>ghost</em> or <em>possessed</em>, and psychological cues like
            <em>dread</em> or <em>trapped</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our 207-term horror lexicon is organized into six signal families:
            <strong>Audio</strong> (sounds, screams, music cues),
            <strong>Visual</strong> (darkness, shadows, gore),
            <strong>Pace</strong> (sudden, rapid, silence),
            <strong>Threat</strong> (weapons, danger, violence),
            <strong>Setting</strong> (isolated, abandoned, night), and
            <strong>Psyche</strong> (dread, panic, madness). Each signal is
            detected when it appears in scene text, dialogue, or action
            descriptions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout this narrative, we'll explore not just which signals
            appear most often, but which ones actually <em>work</em>, measuring
            their effectiveness by correlating signal presence with spikes in
            fear scores. A signal that appears rarely but triggers high fear is
            more powerful than one that's common but emotionally flat.
          </p>
          <h3>IMDB Ratings & Audience Reception</h3>
          <p>
            To understand whether technical horror craftsmanship translates to
            audience acclaim, we've integrated IMDB ratings data for all films
            in our dataset. These ratings represent audience scores on a scale
            from 0 to 10, reflecting how viewers received each film.
          </p>
          <p>
            In <strong>Scene 7</strong>, we explore the relationship between our
            horror metrics (signal effectiveness, fear state transitions, impact
            scores) and IMDB ratings. This reveals whether films with stronger
            technical horror execution, more dynamic pacing, effective signal
            deployment, higher fear peaks, tend to rate higher with audiences,
            or if other factors like story, character development, and
            innovation matter more than pure technical craft.
          </p>
          <p>
            The correlation analysis helps us understand if there's a formula
            for horror success, or if the best films break the rules, blending
            technical mastery with creative storytelling that transcends
            metrics.
          </p>
          <h3>Navigating the Narrative</h3>
          <p>
            This visualization unfolds as a story across eight scenes, each
            revealing a different dimension of horror filmmaking. You can jump
            to any scene using the question bubbles above, or scroll through
            sequentially to follow the complete narrative arc.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Scene 1</strong> shows which signal sources (Audio, Visual,
            Threat, etc.) feed into the scariest outcomes.
            <strong>Scene 2</strong> tracks how fear builds across scenes within
            individual films. <strong>Scene 3</strong> maps where terror spikes
            occur. <strong>Scene 4</strong> visualizes how horror transitions
            between fear states (Calm, Unease, Panic).
            <strong>Scene 5</strong> reveals which signals hit hardest by
            comparing frequency to effectiveness. <strong>Scene 6</strong> shows
            the cumulative impact of signals over time.
            <strong>Scene 7</strong> explores how horror metrics correlate with
            IMDB ratings. <strong>Scene 8</strong> compares each film's unique
            horror recipe across signal families.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each visualization is interactive, hover for details, click to
            explore, and use filters to focus on specific films, time periods,
            or metrics. The data tells a story, but you control how deep you
            dive.
          </p>
          <h3>How We Split Scenes</h3>
          <p>
            Heuristics scan for scene headings (INT, EXT, SCENE numbers,
            CONTINUED cues), cap chunks at 1,200 words, and stitch continuations
            together so the AI reads complete beats while discarding fragments
            without meaningful dialogue or action.

            Each chunk is handed to GPT-4o-mini with a strict JSON contract; if
            validation fails we escalate to GPT-4o. The prompt locks the model
            to horror-specific terminology, emotion scoring guidelines, and a
            thirty-five word summary limit.

          <ul>
            <li>Counts for every signal and its parent family.</li>
            <li>Fear, tension, and sentiment scores on a 0 to 1 scale.</li>

            <li>
              Structured metadata: scene heading, location, time of day, and
              speaking characters.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Reading the Emotional Metrics</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Fear</strong> scores capture sudden shocks and explicit
            dread cues, while <strong>tension</strong> measures the slow
            tightening of suspense. <strong>Sentiment</strong>
            covers overall emotional valence, letting us spot scenes that are
            menacing yet hopeful or bleak and oppressive. Each metric is
            normalized so spikes and lulls are comparable across films.
          </p>
          <h3>Beyond the Signals</h3>
          <p>
            We log scene index, runtime percentile, dialogue to action ratios,
            and stage direction density. These columns reveal pacing
            fingerprints, character involvement, and how much visual description
            versus spoken word drives the fear response, context you can keep in
            mind as you explore the charts below.

                <strong>Interact:</strong> Use the slider to adjust the
                frequency threshold. Lower values show more signals; higher
                values reveal only the most common terms. Hover over nodes to
                see exact counts and impact scores.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Interpret:</strong> On the left are signal families
                (Void, Violence, Scream). On the right are individual signals.
                Thick streams = frequent signals. Bright nodes = high impact
                signals. Watch how families branch into specific terms, some
                families produce many high impact signals, others rely on a few
                powerful ones.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Main lesson:</strong> Horror signals organize into
                distinct families, but not all families are equal. Violence and
                audio cues (like <strong>scream</strong> and
                <strong>blood</strong>) maintain thick streams because they're
                both frequent and impactful. Atmospheric signals like
                <strong>night</strong> appear constantly but generate less fear
                per occurrence. The most effective horror blends families
                strategically, using atmosphere to set the mood, then deploying
                visceral triggers at key moments for maximum impact.

            <h3>How to Read This</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Interact:</strong> Use the dropdown to select a film.
              Start with "Average Across All Films" to see the overall pattern,
              then explore individual titles. The BPM counter shows average fear
              as a pulse rate, higher fear = faster pulse.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Interpret:</strong> The x-axis shows scene progression
              (left = beginning, right = end). The y-axis shows fear intensity
              (0 = calm, 1 = maximum terror). Skull markers appear when fear
              exceeds 0.70. Watch the line's shape: steady climbs, sudden
              spikes, or waves of tension. Compare films to see different pacing
              strategies, some build slowly to a climax, others maintain
              constant tension.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Main lesson:</strong> Effective horror uses strategic
              pacing, not constant terror. Most films hover at moderate fear
              levels (0.3-0.5) with occasional spikes, especially near the end.
              This pattern, alternating calm and chaos, keeps viewers engaged
              longer than nonstop intensity. Patient builds that prime audiences
              for final rushes create more memorable experiences than films that
              peak too early or never let up.

                <strong>Interact:</strong> Use the Fear/Tension buttons to show
                one or both spike types. Click any tombstone or lantern to see a
                mini-chart of fear and tension before/after that moment. Add or
                remove films using the bar above to compare different lineups.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Interpret:</strong> Each row represents one film's
                runtime (left = beginning, right = end). Tombstones appear when
                fear exceeds 0.40. Lanterns appear when tension exceeds 0.40.
                When both appear together, the film is layering shock (fear) on
                top of suspense (tension). Clusters of markers indicate intense
                sequences; sparse markers show restrained pacing.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Main lesson:</strong> The most memorable scares combine
                sudden fear spikes with sustained tension. When a tombstone
                appears alone (fear spike without tension), the scare is brief
                and fades quickly. When lanterns surround a tombstone (tension
                builds before and after the fear spike), the audience stays
                rattled longer. Effective horror sequences use tension to prime
                viewers, then deploy fear spikes at the peak moment for maximum
                impact.

              How to Read This

              <p>
                <strong>Interact:</strong> Hover over cells to see exact
                transition probabilities. Darker cells = higher probability. The
                color intensity shows how likely each transition is.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Interpret:</strong> Rows show the current state (Calm,
                Unease, Panic). Columns show the next state. The diagonal (top
                left to bottom right) shows how often films stay in the same
                state. Off diagonal cells show transitions. Strong Calm→Unease
                and Unease→Panic flows indicate gradual builds. Rare Calm→Panic
                jumps indicate sudden ambushes. High Panic→Panic values show
                sustained terror.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Main lesson:</strong> Horror follows a grammar. Most
                films prefer gradual climbs (Calm→Unease→Panic) over sudden
                jumps (Calm→Panic). Once films reach Panic, they tend to stay
                there, giving viewers few chances to breathe. This pattern,
                careful ramp up followed by sustained intensity, creates more
                effective scares than random state changes. The best horror
                respects this grammar while occasionally breaking it for
                surprise.

                = impact (top right = high impact). Size = frequency (bigger =
                more common). Color = shock vs. tension (red = shock heavy, blue
                = tension heavy). Signals in the top right are both frequent and
                impactful. Signals in the bottom left are rare and weak. Signals
                on the diagonal balance fear and tension.

                <strong>Main lesson:</strong> The most effective horror strategy
                pairs widespread atmosphere with selective spikes. Common
                signals like <strong>night</strong> and
                <strong>dark</strong> maintain baseline tension but generate low
                fear per occurrence. Rare signals like
                <strong>scream</strong> and <strong>blood</strong> generate high
                fear but appear infrequently. The best horror uses atmosphere to
                keep tension elevated, then deploys powerful triggers at key
                moments for maximum impact. This combination, steady mood plus
                strategic spikes, drives the biggest overall emotional lift.

                <strong>Interpret:</strong> Signals are ranked left to right by
                impact (highest on left). The ribbon shows the impact curve,
                steep drop off indicates a power law distribution. Signals above
                0.50 are elite performers. The long tail represents atmospheric
                cues that provide context but minimal direct impact. Compare
                this ranking to the bubble chart to see how frequency and impact
                relate.

                <strong>Main lesson:</strong> Horror follows a power law: a
                small elite of signals (5-10 terms like
                <strong style="color: #ff1f6b">scream</strong> and
                <strong style="color: #ff1f6b">blood</strong>) drive most of the
                fear and tension, while the long tail (hundreds of atmospheric
                terms like <em>night</em> and <em>dark</em>) provides essential
                context but minimal direct impact. This reveals why effective
                horror relies on strategic repetition of proven triggers rather
                than scattering dozens of weak signals. Quality beats quantity:
                a few well placed elite signals outperform hundreds of generic
                references. The best horror scripts identify their elite signals
                and deploy them at key moments, using the background lexicon to
                maintain atmosphere without diluting impact.

                doesn't guarantee audience acclaim. While some highly rated
                films cluster in high impact regions (showing effective signal
                deployment and dynamic pacing can elevate horror), many outliers
                prove that story, character, and innovation matter just as much
                as technical execution. The best horror blends craft with
                creativity, using metrics to inform decisions but not constrain
                them. There's no formula for success, but understanding the
                relationship between technique and reception helps filmmakers
                make informed choices.

                <strong>Interpret:</strong> Each axis represents one signal
                family (Audio, Visual, Pace, Threat, Setting, Psyche). Values
                are normalized (0-1), where 1.0 means that family dominates the
                film's horror approach. The shape reveals the film's strategy:
                balanced (round), focused (spiky), or mixed (irregular).
                Supernatural films emphasize Psyche and Setting. Slashers
                emphasize Threat and Pace. Psychological horror emphasizes
                Psyche and Visual.

                families), others are generalists (balanced across families).
                Neither approach is inherently better, but understanding a
                film's recipe helps explain why it feels different. The most
                unsettling films often blend families strategically, using each
                for its strengths: Setting for atmosphere, Threat for shocks,
                Psyche for lingering dread. This diversity in recipes is what
                makes horror such a rich and varied genre.

            <p>
              After analyzing 129 horror films, 9,760 scenes, and 11,204
              signals, patterns emerge that reveal how effective horror is
              crafted. The journey through these eight scenes tells a complete
              story about the anatomy of fear, from individual signals to
              overall strategies.

          <div class="dataset-overview">
            <h3>The Complete Picture: How Horror Works</h3>
            <p>
              Our analysis reveals that effective horror follows a
              <strong>strategic architecture</strong> built on three
              foundational principles:
            </p>
            <ol style="line-height: 1.8; margin: 20px 0">
              <li>
                <strong>Signal Hierarchy:</strong> Horror signals organize into
                families (Audio, Visual, Pace, Threat, Setting, Psyche), but not
                all signals are equal. A power law governs impact: a small elite
                of signals (like <em>scream</em> and <em>blood</em>) drive most
                of the fear, while hundreds of atmospheric terms provide
                essential context but minimal direct impact. Effective horror
                uses atmosphere to maintain baseline tension, then deploys elite
                signals at key moments for maximum impact.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Strategic Pacing:</strong> Horror follows a grammar.
                Films prefer gradual climbs (Calm→Unease→Panic) over sudden
                jumps, building tension before deploying fear spikes. Most films
                hover at moderate fear levels (0.3-0.5) with occasional spikes,
                especially near the end. The most memorable scares combine
                sudden fear spikes with sustained tension, using tension to
                prime viewers, then deploying shocks at peak moments. This
                pattern, alternating calm and chaos, keeps viewers engaged
                longer than nonstop intensity.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Balanced Recipes:</strong> Every film has a unique
                horror recipe, a signature blend of signal families. Some films
                are specialists (emphasizing one or two families), others are
                generalists (balanced across families). The most unsettling
                films blend families strategically, using each for its
                strengths: Setting for atmosphere, Threat for shocks, Psyche for
                lingering dread. This diversity in recipes is what makes horror
                such a rich and varied genre.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>The Ultimate Insight</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Effective horror is both art and craft.</strong> The craft
              comes from understanding signal hierarchies, pacing patterns, and
              transition grammars, the measurable techniques that create fear.
              But the art comes from knowing when to break the rules, how to
              blend families creatively, and why technical execution alone
              doesn't guarantee audience acclaim. The best horror films use
              metrics to inform decisions but not constrain them, blending
              technical mastery with creative storytelling that transcends the
              data.
            </p>
            <p>
              There's no formula for horror success, but there is a science to
              fear. Understanding signal effectiveness, pacing patterns, and
              transition grammars gives filmmakers tools to craft more impactful
              scares. Yet the outliers in our data, films that break patterns
              and still succeed, remind us that innovation, character, and story
              matter just as much as technique. The anatomy of fear isn't a
              blueprint to follow blindly, but a map to navigate creatively.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 30px; font-style: italic; color: #ffaaaa">
              The data whispers: master the craft, but trust the art. Use
              signals strategically, pace with intention, and blend families
              thoughtfully. Then, when the moment is right, break the rules.
              That's where the magic happens.
