            Before diving into the visuals, here’s what the dataset looks like.
            Every scene went through a scripted GPT-4o-mini review (with GPT-4o
            fallbacks), prompting the model to extract structured stats, tag
            horror signals, and score emotions—turning raw screenplays into
            quantifiable dread.

          <h3>What Is a Signal?</h3>
          <p>
            A signal is any recurring lexical cue that our models associate with
            a spike in fear or tension. Examples include ambience terms like
            <em>night, silence, fog</em>, visceral triggers like
            <em>blood, scream, knife</em>, supernatural hints such as
            <em>ghost</em> or <em>possessed</em>, and psychological cues like
            <em>dread</em> or <em>trapped</em>.
          </p>
          <h3>How We Split Scenes</h3>
          <p>
            Heuristics scan for scene headings (INT, EXT, SCENE numbers,
            CONTINUED cues), cap chunks at 1,200 words, and stitch continuations
            together so the AI reads complete beats while discarding fragments
            without meaningful dialogue or action.

          <h3>Reading the Emotional Metrics</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Fear</strong> scores capture sudden shocks and explicit
            dread cues, while <strong>tension</strong> measures the slow
            tightening of suspense. <strong>Sentiment</strong>
            covers overall emotional valence, letting us spot scenes that are
            menacing yet hopeful or bleak and oppressive. Each metric is
            normalized so spikes and lulls are comparable across films.
          </p>
          <h3>Beyond the Signals</h3>
          <p>
            We log scene index, runtime percentile, dialogue-to-action ratios,
            and stage-direction density. These columns reveal pacing
            fingerprints, character involvement, and how much visual description
            versus spoken word drives the fear response—context you can keep in
            mind as you explore the charts below.

                The Sankey shows how often key terror cues appear and how strongly
                they hit. The thicker the stream, the more frequently that signal
                surfaces; the brighter the node, the more it jolts fear and
                tension in the scenes it touches. On the left you will see broad
                signal families such as the void, the violence, and the scream
                (with the unknown appearing only when a term does not fit the main
                trio), and on the right you will see the individual words those
                families summon.
              </p>
              <p>
                Adjust the threshold to filter out the background noise. You will
                see common ambience like <strong>night</strong> give way to
                visceral triggers such as <strong>scream</strong>, revealing why
                audiences remember certain beats long after the credits roll.
                Watching how each family splits across the right bank shows which
                ingredients feed the shocks and how often those shocks actually
                land. For example, the ribbon feeding <strong>blood</strong> pours
                out of the violence family and stays thick from end to end,
                signalling that gore is both a recurring presence and a reliable
                trigger for fear across the scripts.
              </p>
              <p>
                Main lesson: the most effective horror signals cluster into distinct families—atmospheric
                void, visceral violence, and piercing audio cues. When a signal like <strong>blood</strong>
                maintains a thick stream across the entire flow, it signals both high frequency and
                consistent impact. The strongest horror blends these families rather than relying on
                a single type, creating layered scares that hit multiple senses at once.

            <h3>Track the Pulse</h3>
            <p>
              Choose a film to plot its fear score across the runtime using the
              journey table. The x-axis tracks scene progression, the neon line
              shows fear intensity on a 0 to 1 scale, and skull markers tag any
              moment breaking the 0.70 threshold. The BPM readout converts the
              average fear into a pulse so you can feel the dread build in real
              time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Average fear converts to the faux BPM in the corner, so a steady
              0.45 rating becomes roughly 120 terror beats per minute. In
              <em>Halloween</em>, for example, the line simmers around the mid
              point before spiking near the finale, showing how a patient build
              primes the audience for a final rush. The lesson across the films
              is the same—strategic pacing with alternating calm and chaos keeps
              viewers on edge far better than nonstop noise. We start you with
              the average horror pulse across all 129 scripts, and the featured
              list in the dropdown surfaces the five wildest swings so you can
              compare different pacing strategies in just a few clicks.

                Fear spikes plant a tombstone the moment the score crosses
                <strong>0.40</strong>. Tension spikes at the same scene light up a
                lantern so you can see where suspense and shock overlap without
                guesswork.
              </p>
              <p>
                When both icons appear together—like in the finale of
                <em>Halloween</em>—the story is layering a jump scare on top of a
                slow build. Click any marker to open a quick sparkline that shows
                fear and tension before and after that moment.
              </p>
              <p>
                Main lesson: the most memorable shock sequences pair a sharp fear rise with elevated
                tension in surrounding scenes. If spikes stand alone with flat tension, the scare fades
                fast; when tension climbs before and after, the audience stays rattled far longer.

            This signal lab charts our fiercest horror cues inside a fear versus tension grid.
            Placement shows how much extra fear and tension each term adds versus scenes that
            never utter it, bubble size mirrors how often it appears, and color exposes whether
            the cue leans jump scare shock or slow burn dread. Recast the axes with the dropdown,

                Each bubble marks a cue from the lexicon. Crosshairs reveal its precise score,
                while the dossier pop-up breaks down frequency, impact deltas, and whether it
                leans toward shock or lingering unease. Use the dropdown to see the swarm through
                different lenses.
              </p>
              <p>
                Notice how atmospheric staples like <strong>night</strong> claim the right edge
                for coverage, while <strong>scream</strong> and <strong>blood</strong> blaze in
                the fear heavy quadrant. Signals hugging the diagonal are balanced weapons, perfect
                when you need fear and tension to climb together.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Main lesson:</strong> the heaviest hitters pair widespread ambience with select
                spikes. Use familiar mood setters to keep tension elevated, then drop focused shock triggers
                to punch fear upward—the combination drives the biggest overall lift without overusing any
                single cue.

              the counts in

              <li>
                <strong>Atmosphere sets the trap, violence springs it.</strong>
                Words like <em>night</em> blanket scripts, but when visceral
                cues such as <em>scream</em> or <em>blood</em> arrive, fear and
                tension surge in tandem.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Dread works best in pulses.</strong> Films hover at
                mid-level fear, then fire off clusters of spikes near the
                climax—our heartbeat monitor shows those late surges lighting up
                with skull markers.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Mix your signal families.</strong> Slashers lean on
                Threat and Pace, hauntings lean on Setting and Psyche, and the
                most unsettling films blend all six families to keep nerves
                frayed from every angle.
